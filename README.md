# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
#Introduction
This project showcases customer segmentation using the powerful K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is of utmost importance for businesses aiming to understand their customer base and customize their marketing strategies effectively. In this project, we generate a synthetic dataset comprising 500 customers with attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score. We then employ K-Means clustering to categorize these customers into distinct segments.

#Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is synthetically generated and encompasses the following attributes:
Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A spending score assigned to the customer on a scale of 1 to 100.

#Files
customer_segmentation.xlsx: This Excel file contains the synthetic dataset with information on 500 customers.
kmeans_clustering.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that meticulously guides through the K-Means clustering process, including data preparation, model training, and interpretation of results.
